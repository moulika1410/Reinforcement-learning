**AUTOMATIC TESTCASE GENRATION USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING**

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with how an agent can learn to make
sequential decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. It draws inspiration from
behavioral psychology, where an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback
in the form of rewards or penalties.

Reinforcement learning algorithms use various techniques to learn the optimal policy. One common
approach is Q-learning, which maintains a value function called the Q-function. The Q-function
estimates the expected cumulative reward for taking a particular action in a specific state. The agent
updates the Q-function based on the rewards received and uses it to make decisions about which actions
to take in different states.
